Product Requirements Document: Multi-Device SMS Drip Campaign Platform
Overview

Build an online dashboard allowing users to connect multiple cell phones (with SIM cards), and automate the sending (“dripping”) of SMS messages to a list of recipients imported from a spreadsheet. Messages can be scheduled, spun (spintext), and sent at chosen intervals. The entire system is managed remotely from the dashboard.
Core User Stories

    As a user, I can connect multiple cell phones (with SIMs) to the dashboard via USB, WiFi, or a mobile app, and monitor their SMS status.

    As a user, I can upload a spreadsheet (CSV/XLS) containing a list of recipients and their phone numbers into the dashboard.

    As a user, I can write, spin, and preview outgoing SMS messages, including schedule/flow logic (drip cadences, personalized fields, etc.).

    As a user, I can assign message flows and distribution logic across the connected phones (load balancing, sender rotation, or other business rules).

    As a user, I can manage and view analytics/stats for each phone, message, and recipient, including delivery, response, error rates.

    As a user, I can pause, stop, or reschedule campaigns—even if phones are remote/offline, pending reconnection.

Functional Requirements
1. Device Connection/Management

    Support for connecting phones via:

        USB (direct physical connection)

        WiFi/local app (phones on the same LAN or externally via cloud/mobile app bridge)

    Dashboard auto-detects connected and online devices, shows device status (battery, SIM, signal, etc.)

    Quick “device onboarding” flow with QR/URL or auto-provisioning for ease of scaling

2. List Import and Management

    Upload CSV/XLS/XLSX with required fields: phone number (plus optional name, tags)

    Bulk validation to check for formatting issues, duplicates, DNC (do not contact) lists

    Manual list entry and single-entry UI for smaller campaigns or corrections

3. Message Templates & Spintext

    Compose outgoing message with:

        Spintext/randomization support for A/B variation and deliverability

        Personalization variables (e.g., [FIRST_NAME])

    Message preview for individual and spintext variants

4. Drip Scheduling and Flow

    Specify global or per-recipient timing (e.g., “every X minutes” or group batch at set times)

    Optional controls for time-of-day, time zone, throttling limits, pausing/retrying failed numbers

    Assign drip schedules (evenly or custom rules) to available connected phones

5. Central Campaign Orchestration

    Visual dashboard tracks:

        Status of each campaign (queued, sending, paused, completed)

        Per-device usage/statistics; alerts on errors, carrier blocks, device offline, etc.

    Start, pause, stop, or reschedule campaigns; reassign leads/messages between phones if needed

6. Delivery Analytics

    Real-time dashboard showing:

        Sent, delivered, failed, and responded messages per device and campaign

        Export stats and logs, with delivery receipts if available

        Device health and troubleshooting status

7. Security & Compliance

    Authentication for dashboard access

    Activity logging (who sent/edited/deleted what, and when)

    Tools to handle opt-outs and legal compliance (DNC management, message rate limits)

Technical Agnosticism / Integration

    Device connection must allow for pluggable backend (USB, WiFi, cloud API, or Android/iOS app that bridges SMS to the dashboard)

    Message sending is handled through the physical SIMs of connected phones, ensuring real local origination

    APIs available for extension (connect to CRMs, analytics, external data feeds, webhook out for message status)

    Future-proof: compatible with third-party SMS gateway APIs if hardware is eventually replaced

Non-Functional Requirements

    Responsive dashboard for desktop/mobile

    Capable of handling bulk campaigns (10k+ recipients)

    Scalable device management (10–50+ active phones at once)

    Clear error handling and device troubleshooting guidance

This approach ensures a robust, compliant, scalable SMS drip-marketing platform that leverages physical SIM devices (for best deliverability) but also remains flexible—supporting BYOD (bring your own device), cloud-connected apps, and future integrations.
